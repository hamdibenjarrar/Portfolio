You are going to act as my personal senior developer + brand strategist + content architect.
I need you to analyze and upgrade my entire portfolio (hamdibenjarrar.tech) and prepare it for the next transformation I am building.

Below is my full context, vision, and what we are creating.
You MUST memorize everything and use it to redesign the structure, fix any technical issues, reorganize content, rewrite text, and propose the correct improvements in code + UX + content.

🔵 1. WHO I AM (Memorize this block)

My name is Hamdi Ben Jarrar.
I am a full-stack developer, designer, ecosystem builder, and strategic thinker with a long-term vision.

I combine:

Technology

Human behavior

Business

Strategy

Stoic philosophy

Leadership

AI

Communication

System thinking

I have a strong ability to understand problems deeply and create end-to-end solutions.

I also have:

a background in software development

experience in IT, digital, design, consultancy

a natural talent in communication, teaching, and simplifying complexity

a mindset based on clarity, growth, structure, and purpose

My style is:
Bold, premium, impactful, structured, meaningful, human-centered, and honest.

🔵 2. WHAT I AM BUILDING (Memorize this block)

My portfolio is no longer just a personal website.
It will evolve into a hybrid ecosystem that combines:

1. A premium personal brand (professional + philosophical + educational)

A place where I share:

lessons

leadership insights

stoic ideas

professional advice

communication skills

human development

business & tech knowledge

modern work culture

2. A movement for Tunisians (and universally relevant)

People in Tunisia & globally lack:

communication skills

leadership

autonomy

modern thinking

digital literacy

personal development tools

guidance

My platform will start changing that.

3. An AI council system (inspired by Tenex but unique)

I will build:

a group of AI agents (a council), each with its own personality

their answers merge into LE ROI, the final decision-maker

this system will live inside my portfolio as a tool for users

4. A future community + training + resource hub

The portfolio will later integrate:

a blog

lessons

tools

frameworks

templates

guidance

philosophy

content formats

educational posts

5. A new brand name

We are creating a hybrid name that works in Arabic + English and carries meaning, depth, culture, and future-thinking.
The name must reflect:

leadership

wisdom

growth

clarity

elevation

change

teaching

problem-solving

humanity

innovation

movement

You don’t need to generate the name, just prepare the portfolio structure to welcome it later.

🔵 3. WHAT YOU NEED TO FIX IN THE PORTFOLIO (Very important)

Google AdSense gave the rejection:
“Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content.”

So you MUST:

Analyze the entire codebase (Next.js).

Identify where content is missing or too thin.

Detect any empty routes or pages with low text.

Fix or recreate all pages so they are fully structured and rich with content.

Ensure every page has at least 250–350 words of unique, original, high-quality text.

Add a complete Privacy Policy + Terms (I need you to write them).

Improve SEO, metadata, alt text, and content structure.

Rewrite my About page fully based on all the context I gave you.

Rewrite my “Services” section according to my new mission.

Prepare space for my future “Blog / Lessons / Community” section.

Ensure no page is empty, placeholder, under construction, or low value.

Add accurate semantic HTML.

Improve general design structure but keep my existing theme.

Fix any incorrect code, unused components, or missing content blocks.

Make everything clean, fast, premium, scalable, and consistent with my new identity.

🔵 4. CONTENT TO GENERATE FOR THE WEBSITE (Very important)

You must write and deliver:

A. New About Me Section (long, premium, meaningful)

Include my vision, philosophy, mission, uniqueness, and future ecosystem.

B. Services Page (rewritten with clarity + value)

Make it match my hybrid role:

tech

design

strategy

AI

consulting

communication

ecosystem building

C. Home Page Long Text

Explain who I am, what I do, and what users can find.

D. 3 Blog Posts (800 words each)

Topics:

Communication: why it’s the root of every problem

Leadership vs micromanagement (based on my experience)

Tunisia: digital transformation & new generation of thinkers

E. Privacy Policy
F. Terms of Use
G. Fix any errors in existing code
H. Organize the new structure so the portfolio evolves into the ecosystem smoothly
🔵 5. STYLE & TONE TO USE IN ALL TEXT

Bold

Minimal

Clear

Mature

Stoic

Human

Inspirational but not cheesy

Professional but not corporate

Honest, direct, high quality

Premium brand voice

🔵 6. YOUR TASK

Using everything above:

→ Fix the AdSense issue
